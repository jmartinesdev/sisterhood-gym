                <h3>CROSSFIT</h3>
                <p>
                    What is Cross Training?

                    It combines two or more activities, with more intense exercises that generate high caloric
                    expenditure, but can also be highly recommended for injury prevention.

                    By performing functional, high-intensity activities, practitioners improve physical
                    conditioning, increase muscle definition, and yes, they can lose weight.

                    A cross circuit training or cross-circuit training will allow the practitioner to perform
                    different activities, in addition to using and strengthening other muscle groups.

                    In addition, the cross-training practitioner generates a higher energy consumption than a person
                    who does only one activity, which makes it more efficient but more economical.

                <h3>YOGA</h3>
                <p>
                    Yoga aims to work the body and mind in an interconnected way, performing exercises that help control
                    anxiety, body aches, and stress. To have all the benefits it provides, practices need to be done
                    regularly and preferably with professional help.

                    Meditation in Yoga is one of the first steps to control stress, as it makes the person focus on the
                    present, freeing the mind from problems that cause emotional balance. The fact of having breath
                    control promotes a greater sense of relaxation and balance in the mind.

                    Yoga improves the functioning of the heart, as it regulates blood circulation and the nervous
                    system, in addition to balancing the endocrine system, and controlling the levels of stress
                    hormones.

                <h3>ZUMBA</h3>
                    <p>
                        ZUMBA Fitness is a unique combination of dance and exercise designed to make fitness fun.

                        It is Latin-inspired, incorporating international Latin music, dance moves and gymnastics. Works with all musical rhythms. It is a musical fusion, where rhythms such as salsa, cumbia, merengue, belly dancing, reggaeton, tango, among others, are combined with each other, which helps to enrich the experience of students and instructors.

                        A ZUMBA class combines fast and slow rhythms that tone and sculpt the body. The foundation of training to achieve cardiovascular and muscle toning benefits is aerobic gymnastics.
