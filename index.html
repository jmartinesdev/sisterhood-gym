                    BODYPUMP is a fast-paced, barbell-based workout that's specifically designed to help you get lean,
                    toned and fit. It uses a combination of motivating music, fantastic instructors and scientifically
                    proven moves to help you achieve these targets more quickly than you would working out on your own.
