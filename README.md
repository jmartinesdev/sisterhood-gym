# Sisterhood Gym

Nowadays, the female presence is constant in all the gyms around the world. The woman is looking for muscle definition and a nice, and safe environment. The new fashion is the creation of workout spaces for them, with a gym for women.

A gym for women should take into account not only the physiological differences that exist between men's and women's bodies but also offer ways for women to de-stress, stay in shape and have a lot of fun.

By the way, this is the perfect combination to make women start to have a more active lifestyle and increase their self-confidence. This does not mean that they look for a gym that is exclusively for women, but that they look for an environment where they feel safe and respected and that is conducive to their physical development and mental relaxation.

And that's exactly what Sisterhood Gym does, a professional environment where women can feel safe, respected in search of the perfect body.

- __Color Scheme__

Black is the most powerful and neutral color. It tends to be associated with elegance and strength.
As it is a neutral color, like white, it ends up making the combination with other colors a very simple thing, capable of reflecting different symbologies.
The color, as it is considered strong, ends up standing out against some backgrounds, making it more legible when reading.
Its neutrality helps in combining with other colors, conveying different ideas, such as modernity or conservatism, innovation, traditional, elegance, sophistication, etc.

Gold is the color of the winner. Want a practical example of this statement? It is this color that represents the first place, so the medals are always in gold, with silver being the second place.

the golden color represents success, achievement, and triumph, also very associated with abundance and prosperity, luxury, prestige, sophistication, value, and elegance. Gold also symbolizes high vibration, vigor, superior intelligence, and nobility, carrying charm and building confidence, offering power, persuasion, energy, and intelligence wherever it goes.

For these reasons, we decided on a black (#000) and gold theme (#c3ae3a).
